## Related to the Bonus Task

There was a bonus task to create a modal popup with Launch details on every row item click on the Launches table and display some details about the mission and if there are any video links then embed a playable video on the modal popup.

###### Note :

there was one sub task to add a share option to share the launch details so I have added the share button on modal which shows the mission details on an alert popup (I have added alert for now to show what data can be shared because I currently do not have any endpoint to share this data).
